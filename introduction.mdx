    Try this simple crop prediction example:
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="Python,JavaScript">
      ```python
      import pandas as pd
      from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

      # Load Tanzania rainfall data
      data = pd.read_csv('tanzania_rainfall.csv')
      model = RandomForestRegressor()
      model.fit(data[['temp', 'humidity']], data['yield'])
      prediction = model.predict([[28.5, 75]])
      print(f"Predicted yield: {prediction[0]:.2f} tons/ha")
      ```
      ```javascript
      // Using TensorFlow.js for browser-based prediction
      import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

      const model = tf.sequential({
        layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [2]})]
      });
      model.compile({optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError'});

      // Train with Tanzania crop data
      const xs = tf.tensor2d([[28.5, 75]]); // temp, humidity
      const ys = tf.tensor2d([[3.2]]); // yield
      await model.fit(xs, ys);
